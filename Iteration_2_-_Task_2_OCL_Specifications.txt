1. Each sensor deployed by the system must have a unique id (do not use isUnique)

context SensorRegistry
     inv: self.Contains -> forAll(s1, s2 : Sensor | s1 <> s2 implies s1.id <> s2.id)



2. All sensors deployed in the system are sensors that are maintained by the system. (In
other words, the system does not deploy a sensor which is not registered.)

context SensorRegistry
     inv: self -> includesAll(self.Contains -> forAll(s : Sensor | s.isDeployed = true))



3. Every deployed sensor must be associated with a location that exists in the corresponding location registry.

context Location
     inv: self.Contains -> includes(self.SensorLocationPair.location)



4. Every location maintained by the system is associated with a unique sensor.

context Location
     inv: self.SensorLocationPair -> forAll(sl1, sl2 : SensorLocationPair | sl1 <> sl2 implies sl1.sensor <> sl2.sensor)
